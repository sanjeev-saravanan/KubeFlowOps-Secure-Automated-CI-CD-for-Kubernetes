# Real-Time DevOps Project | Deploy to Kubernetes Using Jenkins & ArgoCD | End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline üöÄ

This project demonstrates a **real-time DevOps workflow** for deploying applications to **Kubernetes (EKS)** using **Jenkins** for CI/CD automation and **ArgoCD** for GitOps-based continuous delivery. It covers the entire pipeline from code push to production deployment, including static code analysis, Docker image creation, and Kubernetes manifest deployment.

---

## Overview üåü

The project automates the following steps:
1. **Code Push**: Developers push code to the **Application Repo**.
2. **Build and Test**: Jenkins triggers a build job, runs tests, and performs static code analysis.
3. **Docker Image Creation**: Builds and pushes a Docker image to **Docker Hub**.
4. **GitOps with ArgoCD**: ArgoCD syncs Kubernetes manifest files from the **Manifest File Repo** and deploys the application to an **EKS cluster**.
5. **Notifications**: Sends deployment notifications to **Slack**.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline automation.
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps-based continuous delivery for Kubernetes.
- **Kubernetes (EKS)**: Container orchestration and deployment.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application.
- **Docker Hub**: Docker image repository.
- **Slack**: Notifications for build and deployment status.
- **Git**: Version control for application and manifest files.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates the entire process from code push to deployment.
- **GitOps with ArgoCD**: Ensures declarative and Git-based Kubernetes deployments.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploys applications to an EKS cluster using manifest files.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Ensures code quality and security before deployment.
- **Notifications**: Sends real-time updates to Slack for build and deployment status.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

## Personal Tips üí°

### For Interviews:
- The interviewers often start by asking you to explain the CI/CD pipeline you have worked on or are currently working on. You must be able to explain it smoothly and confidently so that it comes across as genuine and authentic. If you work on real-time projects a couple of times (like the ones in the videos I mentioned above), you‚Äôll notice a pattern‚Äîmost pipelines follow similar steps.

- Here‚Äôs a tip: Take notes of the steps in a notepad, review them thoroughly, and practice explaining them to yourself. This will help you ensure that you don‚Äôt miss any important steps or mention them in the wrong order during the interview.

- One additional suggestion: Write down all the key points you‚Äôve learned in a notepad first, and go through them multiple times to see if you can explain them clearly. This practice will help you sound confident and well-prepared during the interview.

### For Improvement:
- **Observability and Monitoring**: If you‚Äôre familiar with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack, consider integrating them into this pipeline for better monitoring and observability.
- **Learn from Experts**: Check out tutorials by **Abhishek Veeramalla** and **DevOps Shack** on YouTube for advanced insights and guidance.
